# Change Impact

## Request Summary
- Request: Start implementing the plan beyond scaffold with core runtime components.
- Owner: Adrian
- Date: 2026-02-13

## Scope
- In scope:
  - Add typed settings loader from env + YAML.
  - Enforce symbol whitelist and approval requirement behavior.
  - Add SQLite audit logging for signals/fills.
  - Improve orchestrator flow with explicit decisions and persistence.
  - Add tests for new behavior.
- Out of scope:
  - Real Questrade live order placement.
  - Real Telegram callback/webhook flow.

## Affected Components
- `src/config/*`, `src/orchestration/*`, `apps/orchestrator/main.py`
- `src/storage/*`, `tests/*`, `README.md`

## Impact Analysis
- Functional impact:
  - Moves project from pure scaffold toward usable paper-trading core loop.
- Backward compatibility:
  - Keeps paper mode and placeholders; no production behavior assumed.
- Security impact:
  - No new secrets; still env-driven.
- Performance impact:
  - Minimal overhead from SQLite writes.
- Operational impact:
  - Better auditability and determinism for reviews.

## Risk Assessment
- Risk level: Medium
- Main risks:
  - Misinterpreting placeholder approval behavior.
  - Event schema drift in logger payloads.
- Mitigations:
  - Explicit defaults and tests.
  - Strict JSON event structure per log method.

## Test Plan
- Unit tests for config, whitelist, risk, and audit logger writes.
- Integration test for orchestrator one-pass run.

## Rollback Plan
- Revert PR merge commit.

## Sign-off
- Ready for implementation: Yes
