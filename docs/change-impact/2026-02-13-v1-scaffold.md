# Change Impact

## Request Summary
- Request: Scaffold full v1 implementation baseline for a human-in-the-loop stocks/ETF trading bot (Questrade, extended hours, VPS Python 3.11), with credentials to be provided later.
- Owner: Adrian
- Date: 2026-02-13

## Scope
- In scope:
  - Project structure and Python package scaffold.
  - Config files for strategy/risk/assets.
  - Broker abstraction + Questrade stub adapter.
  - Telegram approval flow skeleton.
  - Risk engine and paper-execution simulator.
  - Orchestrator CLI wiring and docs.
- Out of scope:
  - Live order execution with real credentials.
  - Production-grade backtesting engine.
  - External news/market API provider integrations beyond interfaces.

## Affected Components
- New source code under `src/`, `apps/`, `config/`, `tests/`, `.env.example`.
- Existing docs in `docs/change-impact/` and `README.md`.

## Impact Analysis
- Functional impact:
  - Repository becomes runnable scaffold for paper-trading workflow.
- Backward compatibility:
  - No existing runtime behavior to preserve.
- Security impact:
  - Adds environment-based secret handling pattern, no secrets committed.
- Performance impact:
  - Minimal, prototype-level.
- Operational impact:
  - Enables fast transition to live mode once credentials are supplied.

## Risk Assessment
- Risk level: Medium
- Main risks:
  - Placeholder adapters may be mistaken for production-ready execution.
  - Incomplete provider integration can produce false confidence.
- Mitigations:
  - Explicit README warnings and TODO markers.
  - Paper mode default and strict risk gates.

## Test Plan
- Unit tests:
  - Risk limit and sizing logic.
- Integration tests:
  - Dry-run orchestrator path.
- Regression tests:
  - N/A (new scaffold).
- Manual verification:
  - Run orchestrator in paper mode and verify approval payload generation.

## Rollback Plan
- Revert strategy:
  - Revert feature branch merge.
- Data recovery notes:
  - No persistent production data affected.

## Sign-off
- Ready for implementation: Yes
